# PhantomAdmin

I created this Minecraft server plugin using the Bukkit API to improve server security and also empower administrators to work without distraction.  It makes administrators anonymous in chat (protecting their login names from potential password guessers) and ensures players can't know whether an administrator is online or who he's watching (if anyone).  Mischievous players behave better when they suspect someone might be monitoring them.  Special care was taken to make this plugin convenient to use (for example, holding SHIFT to sneak allows the admin to interact with the world temporarily, avoiding slash command toggles - and admins can easily leap through walls and silently access player inventories and chests without using slash commands or switching to spectator mode).

I stopped working on this project after Minecraft 1.10.  Anyone may use my source code to continue the project, but see the LICENSE file for restrictions.
